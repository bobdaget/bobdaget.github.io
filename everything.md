# Settings <a name="settings"></a>

For some reason, PUBG is a game where the default settings are often bad so there are lot of useful things to know. I've marked important settings in **bold**. You can ctrl+F ★ to see these important settings.

## Graphics

This game generally requires a lot from your PC 

### Display settings

|Setting| Value | Comment |
|--|--|--|
| Display mode| Full screen|
| In game FPS cap | Unlimited | Limit through some other app / setting if you want to
| Brightness| 100|

### Advanced settings

|Setting| Value | Comment |
|--|--|--|
| Render scale| Up to you, I use 100 | Anything below will provide better performance but look worse.
| In game FPS cap | Unlimited | Limit through some other app / setting if you want to
| FPP Camera FOV| Up to you, I use 95. |It's a balance between too high and too low.
| Anti-Aliasing| Up to you | Some pros use very low, some use ultra. I used to use medium when my computer was worse. Personal preference with not much performance impact.
| Post-processing| Very low| it's just distracting.
| **★ Effects**| **Ultra**| **makes it easier to see molotovs and fire**
| View distance| Up to you| just affects rendering of buildings, doesn't really affect gameplay.
| **★ Motion blur**| **Disable**|
| Direct X Version | I don't know.| If your game crashes maybe try whatever it is not set on.

## Audio

### Sound

- UI
	- Disable or turn it down because it's loud by default.
	- If you are looting and someone runs up to you, you want to hear them so you can stop looting and shoot them.
- Weapon sound effects
	- If you've been playing the game for a while, your ears are probably used to legacy
	- Otherwise doesn't matter, though I do like the legacy sounds!
- **HRTF**
	- **★ Enable, better 3d audio positioning.**

### Voice chat

- Voice input mode
	- Push to talk, I think it's always on by default which is embarrassing
- Voice chat channel
	- You can change this in-game with CTRL+Y.

## Controls

### Mouse

- General sensitivity
	- This is the sens for looking around without aiming
- Aim sensitivity
	- This is the sensitivity for when you 'aim' which is the more-accurate hip firing feature in PUBG
- Vertical Sensitivity Multiplier
	- The way recoil works in PUBG is that shoot throws your aim off and you need to counteract it with your mouse
	- A lot of people increase the vertical sens multiplier to make it easier to control recoil
	- Many of us are using 1.5 currently. See what works for you.
- Universal sensitivity for all scopes
	- This is personal preference
	- I do think that enabling it creates consistency across your scopes

Sensitivity general recommendations:
- General sensitivity should generally be slightly higher than your AIM/ADS/Scoping sensitivity
- AIM/ADS/Scoping sensitivities should generally be the same number
- Again this is preference but this is how a lot of people set it up

### Key Input Method

I don't know what the default settings are but here's what people generally use.

|Setting|Value| Comment |
|--|--|--|
| Crouch | Toggle |
| Prone| Toggle |
| Walk | Hold |
| Free Look| Hold |
| Hold Breath | Hold |
| Canted Sights | Toggle |
| Peek | Hold | This is leaning
| Map | Toggle |
| Aim | Toggle |
| ADS | Toggle/Hold | This is personal preference. Note: keybinds setting will look at AIM/ADS keybinds because that is important to have on separate buttons.

## Key bindings

There are a lot of useful key binds in PUBG that are not default. Some can have large impacts on your gameplay.

### Common

|Setting|Value| Comment |
|--|--|--|
| **★ Jump/Vault** | **Unbind this** | **Having this on the same key will get you killed because you'll jump when you mean to vault and vice versa.**
|**★ Jump** |**Space generally** |
|**★ Vault** | **V generally** | **up to you, I think this is the default _change perspective_ keybind so if you play TPP you'll want to adjust that**
| Auto run / auto accelerate | something easy to access | I forget what the default is but auto run is nice to use

### Combat

|Setting|Value| Comment |
|--|--|--|
|**★ Aim / ADS** |**Unbind this** | **Having aim / ads on the same key causes your ADS to take longer because the game has to register if you're going to hold or not.**
|**★ Aim** |**Typically a mouse button** |
|**★ ADS** |**Right click** |
|**★ Next weapon** |**Unbind this** |**Just use 1-5. I accidentally swap if I have it on scroll wheel**
|**★ Previous weapon** |**Unbind this** |**Just use 1-5. I accidentally swap if I have it on scroll wheel**
|Equip frag grenade| G | This will overlap with the default _throwable items wheel_ keybind so you'd have to change that. The reason I use this is because in certain situations you want  to throw a nade and you don't want to waste time getting it out by swapping which one you're holding. This makes hitting  G bring that nade out immediately.
|Equip smoke grenade| Shift + G | Similar to frag grenade. If you need to smoke you want to do it ASAP, for example when a team mate is knocked an in the open.
|Radio message wheel| Middle click | Not sure what the default is, but this is how you mark things you're looking at.

### Item

|Setting|Value| Comment |
|--|--|--|
|Use first aid kit|H|Sometimes you need to heal ASAP, like in a fight. Hitting a key is the fastest way to do so.|

### Motorcycle

|Setting|Value| Comment |
|--|--|--|
|**★ Air control - lean back**|**L CTRL**| **1. Default of space causes you to break in the air which messes you up. 2. Mentally easier to understand the lower key is back. I actually use the 'back' button on the side of my mouse.** 
|**★ Air control - lean forward**|**L Shift**|**Mentally easier to understand the higher key is forward. I actually use the 'forward' button on the side of my mouse.**

### Vehicle seats

|Setting|Value| Comment |
|--|--|--|
|Vehicle drivers seat|W and Shift+W|W = get in front seat and go. Saves time when you need to gtfo|
|Seat 2|Shift+2 (or whatever you want)|I find shift+2 easier to hit than ctrl+2. Important for drive-bys or med-ing while riding.
|Seat 3|Shift+3 (or whatever you want)|I find shift+3 easier to hit than ctrl+3. Important for drive-bys or med-ing while riding.
|Seat 4|Shift+4 (or whatever you want)|I find shift+4 easier to hit than ctrl+4. Important for drive-bys or med-ing while riding.
|Seat 5|Shift+5 (or whatever you want)|I find shift+5 easier to hit than ctrl+5. Important for drive-bys or med-ing while riding.

### UI

|Setting|Value| Comment |
|--|--|--|
|**★ Quick marker**|**Mouse 1 and another key**|**This on M1 makes it so when you shoot, you indicate on the compass where you are shooting via the color ping. The other key allows you to do the same without shooting.** |

### Spectator mode

|Setting|Value| Comment |
|--|--|--|
|Next player |Scroll up| Easier than default keybind |
|Previous player |Scroll down| Easier than default keybind |

## Gameplay

Random features and settings that PUBG added, some affect performance some are quality of life.

### UI

- Inventory character render
	- Disable for performance
- Colorblind mode
	- Protanopia turns blood blue
	- Korean settings also have a similar effect
		1.  Launch Steam > go to Library.
		2.  Locate PUBG and right click on the game.
		3.  Now select Properties.
		4.  Select Set launch options (you should find this option at the bottom).
		5.  Type -koreanrating as shown in the screenshot below > hit OK.
- **★ Weapon slot HUD**
	- **Enable to see what weapons you're carrying at all times in the HUD**
- Killfeed limit
	- 10, more information about who killed who is always better
- Hide nicknames in killfeed
	- This is for streamers
- Compass background
	- Enable, allows you to see the compass better
- On-screen key guide
	- If enabled you will see control tips on the screen. Generally everyone disables but if you're just starting could be useful.

### Functionalities

- **★ Auto reload**
	- **Disable, bad**
- **★ Default firing mode settings**
	- **PUBG used to not have this. you'd have to pick up a gun and change the firing mode in addition to loading it to be able to use it in full auto. This was terrible when you were in a rush. Below are my recommended settings:**

|Gun | Setting | Comment |
|--|--|--|
| Handguns | Automatic|
| SMGs| Automatic|
| Secondary SMGs | Burst| doesn't matter this applies to no guns in the game
| ARs | Automatic|
| Secondary ARs | ? | I prefer single tapping with the M16 and Mutant. Up to you
| DMRs | Single| the MK14 is the only DMR with automatic and generally you only want that in certain situations.

- **★ Auto-attachment settings**
	- **PUBG introduced these features to make picking up and dealing with attachments better. They improved quality of life greatly, especially when swapping weapons.**
	- Recommended settings:
		- Auto equip attachments with interaction key - Enable
		- Auto replace attachments - Enable
		- Auto equip attachments from inventory - Enable
- Livestream Screens
	- Disable, they are distracting  and suck up performance

### Replay

- Disable these settings for performance, enable them if you want to play back games or watch how you died. 

### Network

- Network debug statistics
	- Enable to see your ping
